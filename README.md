# ADXL357-Arduino
A library to operate the ADXL357 accelerometer on Arduino-compatible microcontrollers.

This library is inspired from the [Seeed Technology Inc.](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_ADXL357B) ADXL357b library. This version had correct defines for register addresses and a doxygen documentation.
